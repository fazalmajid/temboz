Rather than condemn Biden for ignoring these questions -- the natural instinct of a healthy press when it comes to a presidential election -- journalists have instead led the way in concocting excuses to justify his silence.</p><p>After the Post&#8217;s first article, both that newspaper and other news outlets have published numerous other emails and texts purportedly written to and from Hunter reflecting his efforts to induce his father to take actions as Vice President beneficial to the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, on whose board of directors Hunter sat for a monthly payment of $50,000, as well as proposals for lucrative business deals in China that traded on his influence with his father.</p><p>Individuals included in some of the email chains have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-china-email-source-verifies">confirmed the contents' authenticity</a>. One of Hunter&#8217;s former business partners, Tony Bubolinski, has stepped forward on the record to confirm the authenticity of many of the emails and to insist that Hunter along with Joe Biden's brother Jim were planning on including the former Vice President in at least one deal in China. And GOP pollster Frank Luntz, who appeared in one of the published email chains, <a href="https://twitter.com/FrankLuntz/status/1319285351165222917">appeared to confirm the authenticity</a> as well, though he <a href="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1319308050310877187">refused to answer</a> follow-up questions about it.</p><p>Thus far, no proof has been offered by Bubolinski that Biden ever consummated his participation in any of those discussed deals. The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hunter-bidens-ex-business-partner-alleges-father-knew-about-venture-11603421247">says</a> that it found no corporate records reflecting that a deal was finalized and that "text messages and emails related to the venture that were provided to the Journal by Mr. Bobulinski, mainly from the spring and summer of 2017, don&#8217;t show either Hunter Biden or James Biden discussing a role for Joe Biden in the venture."</p><p>But nobody claimed that any such deals had been consummated -- so the conclusion that one had not been does not negate the story. Moreover, some texts and emails whose authenticity has not been disputed state that Hunter was adamant that any discussions about the involvement of the Vice President be held only verbally and never put in writing.</p><p>Beyond that, the Journal's columnist Kimberly Strassel <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-biden-family-legacy-11603409528">reviewed a stash of documents</a> and "found correspondence corroborates and expands on emails recently published by the New York Post," including ones where Hunter was insisting that it was his connection to his father that was the greatest asset sought by the Chinese conglomerate with whom they were negotiating. The New York Times on Sunday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/us/politics/bidens-china.html">reached a similar conclusion</a>: while no documents prove that such a deal was consummated, "records produced by Mr. Bobulinski show that in 2017, Hunter Biden and James Biden were involved in negotiations about a joint venture with a Chinese energy and finance company called CEFC China Energy," and "make clear that Hunter Biden saw the family name as a valuable asset, angrily citing his 'family&#8217;s brand' as a reason he is valuable to the proposed venture."</p><p>These documents also demonstrate, reported the Times, "that the countries that Hunter Biden, James Biden and their associates planned to target for deals overlapped with nations where Joe Biden had previously been involved as vice president." Strassel noted that "a May 2017 'expectations' document shows Hunter receiving 20% of the equity in the venture and holding another 10% for 'the big guy'&#8212;who Mr. Bobulinski attests is Joe Biden." And the independent journalist Matt Taibbi <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/with-the-hunter-biden-expose-suppression">published an article</a> on Sunday with ample documentation suggesting that Biden's attempt to replace a Ukranian prosecutor in 2015 benefited Burisma.</p><p>All of these new materials, the authenticity of which has never been disputed by Hunter Biden or the Biden campaign, raise important questions about whether the former Vice President and current front-running presidential candidate was aware of efforts by his son to peddle influence with the Vice President for profit, and also whether the Vice President ever took actions in his official capacity with the intention, at least in part, of benefitting his son's business associates. But in the two weeks since the Post published its initial story, a union of the nation's most powerful entities, including its news media, have taken extraordinary steps to obscure and bury these questions rather than try to provide answers to them.</p><p>The initial documents, claimed the New York Post, were obtained when the laptops containing them were left at a Delaware repair shop with water damage and never picked up, allowing the owner to access its contents and then turn them over to both the FBI and a lawyer for Trump advisor Rudy Giuliani. The repair store owner confirmed this narrative in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-emails-computer-repair-store-owner-john-paul-mac-isaac">interviews with news outlets</a> and then (under penalty of prosecution) <a href="https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/oct/18/hunter-biden-left-laptop-at-repair-shop-owner-tell/">to a Senate Committee;</a> he also provided the receipt purportedly signed by Hunter. Neither Hunter nor the Biden campaign has denied these claims.</p><p>Publication of that initial New York Post story provoked <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/10/15/facebook-and-twitter-cross-a-line-far-more-dangerous-than-what-they-censor/">a highly unusual censorship campaign</a> by Facebook and Twitter. Facebook, through a long-time former Democratic Party operative, vowed to suppress the story pending its &#8220;fact-check,&#8221; one that has as of yet produced no public conclusions. And while Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey apologized for Twitter&#8217;s handling of the censorship and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/technology/twitter-new-york-post.html">reversed the policy</a> that led to the blocking of all links the story, the New York Post, the nation&#8217;s fourth-largest newspaper, continues to be locked out of its Twitter account, unable to post as the election approaches, for almost two weeks.</p><p>After that initial censorship burst from Silicon Valley, whose workforce and oligarchs <a href="https://www.protocol.com/tech-political-donors-2020-amazon-apple-facebook-google-microsoft">have donated</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valley-opens-wallet-joe-biden/">almost entirely</a> to the Biden campaign, it was the nation's media outlets and former CIA and other intelligence officials who took the lead in constructing reasons why the story should be dismissed, or at least treated with scorn. As usual for the Trump era, the theme that took center stage to accomplish this goal was an unsubstantiated claim about the Kremlin responsibility for the story.</p><p>Numerous news outlets, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/10/21/trump-presidency-summary/">including the Intercept</a>, quickly cited a public letter signed by former CIA officials and other agents of the security state claiming that the documents have the &#8220;classic trademarks" of a &#8220;Russian disinformation&#8221; plot. But, as media outlets and even intelligence agencies are now slowly admitting, no evidence has ever been presented to corroborate this assertion. On Friday, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/us/politics/hunter-biden-laptop.html">reported</a> that &#8220;no concrete evidence has emerged that the laptop contains Russian disinformation&#8221; and the paper said even the FBI has &#8220;acknowledged that it had not found any Russian disinformation on the laptop.&#8221;</p><p>The Washington Post on Sunday <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/10/24/hunter-biden-laptop-disinformation/">published an op-ed</a> -- by Thomas Rid, one of those centrists establishmentarian professors whom media outlets routinely use to provide the facade of expert approval for deranged conspiracy theories -- that contained this extraordinary proclamation: "We must treat the Hunter Biden leaks as if they were a foreign intelligence operation &#8212; even if they probably aren't."</p><a class="image-link image2 image2-236-685" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd27e905-5642-4021-a5e4-3f0903eed77d_685x236.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd27e905-5642-4021-a5e4-3f0903eed77d_685x236.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cd27e905-5642-4021-a5e4-3f0903eed77d_685x236.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:236,&quot;width&quot;:685,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:116791,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

        </style></a><p>Despite this complete lack of evidence, the Biden campaign adopted this phrase used by intelligence officials and media outlets as its mantra for why the materials should not be discussed and why they would not answer basic questions about them. &#8220;I think we need to be very, very clear that what he's doing here is amplifying Russian misinformation," <a href="https://twitter.com/kthomasdc/status/1319344962773929990?s=21">said</a> Biden Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield about the possibility that Trump would raise the Biden emails at Thursday night&#8217;s debate. Biden&#8217;s senior advisor Symone Sanders <a href="https://twitter.com/aseitzwald/status/1319434174558883840?s=21">similarly warned on MSNBC</a>: &#8220;if the president decides to amplify these latest smears against the vice president and his only living son, that is Russian disinformation."</p><p>The few mainstream journalists who tried merely to discuss these materials have been vilified. For the crime of simply noting it on Twitter that first day, New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman had her name <a href="https://twitter.com/rosiegray/status/1316432851647303680?s=21">trend all morning</a> along with the derogatory nickname &#8220;MAGA Haberman.&#8221; CBS News&#8217; Bo Erickson was <a href="https://twitter.com/MSignorile/status/1317447105221431301">widely attacked</a> even by his <a href="https://twitter.com/kurteichenwald/status/1317527636919410688">some in the media</a> simply for asking Biden what his response to the story was. And Biden himself refused to answer, accusing Erickson of spreading a "smear."</p><p>That it is irresponsible and even unethical to mention these documents became a pervasive view in mainstream journalism. The NPR Public Editor, in <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/nprpubliceditor/status/1319281101223940096?s=21">an anazing statement</a> representative of much of the prevailing media mentality, explicitly justified NPR&#8217;s refusal to cover the story on the ground that &#8220;we do not want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories . . .

When Trump insisted there were multiple ways to verify the materials on the laptop, Stahl simply <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/60-minutes-anchor-insists-hunter-175446505.html">repeated the same phrase</a>: &#8220;it can&#8217;t be verified.&#8221;</p><p>After the final presidential debate on Thursday night, a CNN panel <a href="https://twitter.com/marymargolohan/status/1319478342849089543?s=21">mocked the story</a> as too complex and obscure for anyone to follow -- a self-fulfilling prophecy given that, as the network's media reporter Brian Stelter <a href="https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1319720529557884929">noted with pride</a>, the story has barely been mentioned either on CNN or MSNBC. As the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/2020-election-misinformation-distortions">noted on Friday</a>: "most viewers of CNN and MSNBC would not have heard much about the unconfirmed Hunter Biden emails.... CNN&#8217;s mentions of &#8220;Hunter&#8221; peaked at 20 seconds and MSNBC&#8217;s at 24 seconds one day last week."</p><p>On Sunday, CNN's Christiane Amanpour barely pretended to be interested in any journalism surrounding the story, scoffing during an interview at requests from the RNC's Elizabeth Harrington to cover the story and verify the documents by telling her: "We're not going to do your work for you." Watch how the U.S.'s most mainstream journalists are openly announcing their refusal to even consider what these documents might reflect about the Democratic front-runner:</p><div id="youtube2-oSB_fQHbSiA" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;oSB_fQHbSiA&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oSB_fQHbSiA?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div><p>These journalists are desperate not to know. As Taibbi <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/with-the-hunter-biden-expose-suppression">wrote on Sunday</a> about this tawdry press spectacle: " The least curious people in the country right now appear to be the credentialed news media, a situation normally unique to tinpot authoritarian societies."</p><p>All of those excuses and pretexts &#8212; emanating largely from a national media that is all but explicit in their eagerness for Biden to win &#8212; served for the first week or more after the Post story to create a cone of silence around this story and, to this very day, a protective shield for Biden. As a result, the front-running presidential candidate knows that he does not have to answer even the most basic questions about these documents because most of the national press has already signaled that they will not press him to do so; to the contrary, they will concoct defenses on his behalf to avoid discussing it.</p><p>The relevant questions for Biden raised by this new reporting are as glaring as they are important. Yet Biden has had to answer very few of them yet because he has not been asked and, when he has, media outlets have justified his refusal to answer rather than demand that he do so. We submitted nine questions to his campaign about these documents that the public has the absolute right to know, including:</p><ul><li><p>whether he claims any the emails or texts are fabricated (and, if so, which specific ones);</p></li><li><p>whether he knows if Hunter did indeed drop off laptops at the Delaware repair store;</p></li><li><p>whether Hunter ever asked him to meet with Burisma executives or whether he in fact did so;</p></li><li><p>whether Biden ever knew about business proposals in Ukraine or China being pursued by his son and brother in which Biden was a proposed participant and,</p></li><li><p>how Biden could justify expending so much energy as Vice President demanding that the Ukrainian General Prosecutor be fired, and why the replacement &#8212; Yuriy Lutsenko, someone who <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-parliament-prosecutor-idUSKCN0Y311A">had no experience in law</a>; was a crony of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko; and himself had a history of corruption allegations  &#8212; was acceptable if Biden&#8217;s goal really was to fight corruption in Ukraine rather than benefit Burisma or control Ukrainian internal affairs for some other objective.</p></li></ul><p></p><a class="image-link image2 image2-555-720" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62dd204d-2223-424d-9465-c306e7c03507_720x555.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62dd204d-2223-424d-9465-c306e7c03507_720x555.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/62dd204d-2223-424d-9465-c306e7c03507_720x555.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:555,&quot;width&quot;:720,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:356604,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

        </style></a><p>Though the Biden campaign indicated that they would respond to the Intercept&#8217;s questions, they have not done so. A <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffmason1/status/1319436702042161157?s=21">statement they released</a> to other outlets contains no answers to any of these questions except to claim that Biden &#8220;has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any business overseas.&#8221; To date, even as the Biden campaign echoes the baseless claims of media outlets that anyone discussing this story is &#8220;amplifying Russian disinformation,&#8221; neither Hunter Biden nor the Biden campaign have even said whether they claim the emails and other documents -- which they and the press continue to label "Russian disinformation" -- are forgeries or whether they are authentic.</p><p>The Biden campaign clearly believes it has no need to answer any of these questions by virtue of a panoply of media excuses offered on its behalf that collapse upon the most minimal scrutiny:</p><p><strong>First</strong>, the claim that the material is of suspect authenticity or cannot be verified -- the excuse used on behalf of Biden by Leslie Stahl and Christiane Amanpour, among others -- is blatantly false for numerous reasons. As someone who has reported similar large archives in partnership with numerous media outlets around the world (including the Snowden archive in 2014 and <a href="https://theintercept.com/series/secret-brazil-archive/">the Intercept&#8217;s Brazil Archive</a> over the last year <a href="https://apnews.com/0e998ebedbd64f6d868a3fa570ed1f6c">showing corruption by high-level Bolsonaro officials</a>), and who also covered the reporting of similar archives by other outlets (the Panama Papers, the WikiLeaks war logs of 2010 and DNC/Podesta emails of 2016), it is clear to me that the trove of documents from Hunter Biden&#8217;s emails has been verified in ways quite similar to those.</p><p>With an archive of this size, one can never independently authenticate every word in every last document unless the subject of the reporting voluntarily confirms it in advance, which they rarely do. What has been done with similar archives is journalists obtain enough verification to create high levels of journalistic confidence in the materials. Some of the materials provided by the source can be independently confirmed, proving genuine access by the source to a hard drive, a telephone, or a database. Other parties in email chains can confirm the authenticity of the email or text conversations in which they participated. One investigates non-public facts contained in the documents to determine that they conform to what the documents reflect. Technology specialists can examine the materials to ensure no signs of forgeries are detected.</p><p>This is the process that enabled the largest and most established media outlets around the world to report similar large archives obtained without authorization. In those other cases, no media outlet was able to verify every word of every document prior to publication. There was no way to prove the negative that the source or someone else had not altered or forged some of the material. That level of verification is both unattainable and unnecessary. What is needed is substantial evidence to create high confidence in the authentication process.</p><p>The Hunter Biden documents have at least as much verification as those other archives that were widely reported. There are sources in the email chains who have verified that the published emails are accurate. The archive contains private photos and videos of Hunter whose authenticity is not in doubt. A former business partner of Hunter has stated, unequivocally and on the record, that not only are the emails authentic but they describe events accurately, including proposed participation by the former Vice President in at least one deal Hunter and Jim Biden were pursuing in China. And, most importantly of all, neither Hunter Biden nor the Biden campaign has even suggested, let alone claimed, that a single email or text is fake.</p><p>Why is the failure of the Bidens to claim that these emails are forged so significant? Because when journalists report on a massive archive, they know that the most important event in the reporting's authentication process comes when the subjects of the reporting have an opportunity to deny that the materials are genuine. Of course that is what someone would do if major media outlets were preparing to publish, or in fact were publishing, fabricated or forged materials in their names; they would say so in order to sow doubt about the materials if not kill the credibility of the reporting.</p><p>The silence of the Bidens may not be dispositive on the question of the material&#8217;s authenticity, but when added to the mountain of other authentication evidence, it is quite convincing: at least equal to the authentication evidence in other reporting on similarly large archives.</p><p><strong>Second</strong>, the oft-repeated claim from news outlets and CIA operatives that the published emails and texts were &#8220;Russian disinformation&#8221; was, from the start, obviously baseless and reckless. No evidence &#8212; literally none &#8212; has been presented to suggest involvement by any Russians in the dissemination of these materials, let alone that it was part of some official plot by Moscow. As always, anything is possible &#8212; when one does not know for certain what the provenance of materials is, nothing can be ruled out &#8212; but in journalism, evidence is required before news outlets can validly start blaming some foreign government for the release of information. And none has ever been presented. Yet the claim that this was "Russian disinformation" was published in countless news outlets, television broadcasts, and the social media accounts of journalists, typically by pointing to the evidence-free claims of ex-CIA officials.</p><p>Worse is the &#8220;disinformation&#8221; part of the media&#8217;s equation. How can these materials constitute &#8220;disinformation&#8221; if they are authentic emails and texts actually sent to and from Hunter Biden? The ease with which news outlets that are supposed to be skeptical of evidence-free pronouncements by the intelligence community instead printed their assertions about "Russian disinformation" is alarming in the extreme. But they did it because they instinctively wanted to find a reason to justify ignoring the contents of these emails, so claiming that Russia was behind it, and that the materials were "disinformation," became their placeholder until they could figure out what else they should say to justify ignoring these documents.</p><p><strong>Third</strong>, the media rush to exonerate Biden on the question of whether he engaged in corruption vis-a-vis Ukraine and Burisma rested on what are, at best, factually dubious defenses of the former Vice President. Much of this controversy centers on Biden's aggressive efforts while Vice President in late 2015 to force the Ukrainian government to fire its Chief Prosecutor, Viktor Shokhin, and replace him with someone acceptable to the U.S., which turned out to be Yuriy Lutsenko. These events are undisputed by virtue of <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oesl2RXpfPQ">a video of Biden boasting</a> in front of an audience of how he flew to Kiev and forced the Ukrainians to fire Shokhin, upon pain of losing $1 billion in aid.</p><p>But two towering questions have long been prompted by these events, and the recently published emails make them more urgent than ever: 1) was the firing of the Ukrainian General Prosecutor such a high priority for Biden as Vice President of the U.S. because of his son's highly lucrative role on the board of Burisma, and 2) if that was not the motive, why was it so important for Biden to dictate who the chief prosecutor of Ukraine was?</p><p>The standard answer to the question about Biden's motive -- offered both by Biden and his media defenders -- is that he, along with the IMF and EU, wanted Shokhin fired because the U.S. and its allies were eager to clean up Ukraine, and they viewed Shokhin as insufficiently vigilant in fighting corruption.</p><p>&#8220;Biden&#8217;s brief was to sweet-talk and jawbone Poroshenko into making reforms that Ukraine&#8217;s Western benefactors wanted to see as,&#8221; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/14/hunter-bidens-alleged-laptop-an-explainer/">wrote the Washington Post&#8217;s Glenn Kessler</a> in what the Post calls a &#8220;fact-check.&#8221; Kessler also endorsed the key defense of Biden: that the firing of Shokhin was bad for Burima, not good for it. &#8220;The United States viewed [Shokhin] as ineffective and beholden to Poroshenko and Ukraine&#8217;s corrupt oligarchs. In particular, Shokin had failed to pursue an investigation of the founder of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky,&#8221; Kessler claims.</p><p>But that claim does not even pass the laugh test. The U.S. and its European allies are not opposed to corruption by their puppet regimes. They are allies with the most corrupt regimes on the planet, from Riyadh to Cairo, and always have been. Since when does the U.S. devote itself to ensuring good government in the nations it is trying to control? If anything, allowing corruption to flourish has been a key tool in enabling the U.S. to exert power in other countries and to open up their markets to U.S. companies.</p><p>Beyond that, if increasing prosecutorial independence and strengthening anti-corruption vigilance were really Biden's goal in working to demand the firing of the Ukrainian chief prosecutor, why would the successor to Shokhin, Yuriy Lutsenko, possibly be acceptable? Lutsenko, after all, had "no legal background as general prosecutor," was principally known only as a lackey of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, was forced in 2009 to "resign as interior minister after being detained by police at Frankfurt airport for being drunk and disorderly," and "was subsequently jailed for embezzlement and abuse of office, though his defenders said the sentence was politically motivated."</p><p></p><a class="image-link image2 image2-622-761" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff79bb0ce-de1e-4581-871a-a1a6b5062e7b_761x622.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff79bb0ce-de1e-4581-871a-a1a6b5062e7b_761x622.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f79bb0ce-de1e-4581-871a-a1a6b5062e7b_761x622.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:622,&quot;width&quot;:761,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:320741,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

        </style></a><p>Is it remotely convincing to you that Biden would have accepted someone like Lutsenko if his motive really were to fortify anti-corruption prosecutions in Ukraine? Yet that's exactly what Biden did: he personally told Poroshenko that Lutsenko was an acceptable alternative and promptly released the $1 billion after his appointment was announced. Whatever Biden's motive was in using his power as U.S. Vice President to change the prosecutor in Ukraine, his acceptance of someone like Lutsenko strongly suggests that combatting Ukrainian corruption was not it.</p><p>As for the other claim on which Biden and his media allies have heavily relied &#8212; that firing Shokhin was not a favor for Burisma because Shokhin was not pursuing any investigations against Burisma &#8212; the evidence does not justify that assertion.</p><p>It is true that no evidence, including these new emails, constitute proof that Biden's motive in demanding Shokhin's termination was to benefit Burisma. But nothing demonstrates that Shokhin was impeding investigations into Burisma. Indeed, the New York Times in 2019 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/us/politics/biden-son-ukraine.html">published one of the most comprehensive investigations</a> to date of the claims made in defense of Biden when it comes to Ukraine and the firing of this prosecutor, and, while noting that "no evidence has surfaced that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing for the prosecutor general&#8217;s dismissal," this is what its reporters concluded about Shokhin and Burisma:</p><blockquote><p>[Biden's] pressure campaign eventually worked. The prosecutor general, long a target of criticism from other Western nations and international lenders, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/world/europe/political-stability-in-the-balance-as-ukraine-ousts-top-prosecutor.html">voted out months later by the Ukrainian Parliament</a>.</p><p><strong>Among those who had a stake in the outcome was Hunter Biden</strong>, Mr. Biden&#8217;s younger son, who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch <strong>who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>The Times added: "Mr. Shokhin&#8217;s office had oversight of investigations into [Burisma's billionaire founder] Zlochevsky and his businesses, including Burisma." By contrast, they said, Lutsenko, the replacement approved by Vice President Biden, "initially continued investigating Mr. Zlochevsky and Burisma, but cleared him of all charges within 10 months of taking office."</p><p>So whether or not it was Biden's intention to confer benefits on Burisma by demanding Shokhin's firing, it ended up quite favorable for Burisma given that the utterly inexperienced Lutesenko "cleared [Burisma's founder] of all charges within 10 months of taking office."</p><p>The new comprehensive report from journalist Taibbi on Sunday also strongly supports the view that there were clear antagonisms between Shokhin and Burisma, such that firing the Ukrainian prosecutor would have been beneficial for Burisma. Taibbi, who reported for many years while based in Russia and remains very well-sourced in the region, detailed:</p><blockquote><p>For all the negative press about Shokhin, there&#8217;s no doubt that there were multiple active cases involving Zlochevsky/Burisma during his short tenure. This was even once admitted by American reporters, before it became taboo to describe such cases untethered to words like &#8220;dormant.&#8221; Here&#8217;s how Ken Vogel at the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/us/politics/biden-son-ukraine.html">New York Times </a></em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/us/politics/biden-son-ukraine.html">put it</a> in May of 2019:</p><p>"When Mr. Shokhin became prosecutor general in February 2015, he inherited several investigations into the company and Mr. Zlochevsky, including for suspicion of tax evasion and money laundering. Mr. Shokin also opened an investigation into the granting of lucrative gas licenses to companies owned by Mr. Zlochevsky when he was the head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources."</p><p>Ukrainian officials I reached this week confirmed that multiple cases were active during that time.</p><p>&#8220;There were different numbers, but from 7 to 14,&#8221; says Serhii Horbatiuk, former head of the special investigations department for the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office, when asked how many Burisma cases there were.</p><p>&#8220;There may have been two to three episodes combined, and some have already been closed, so I don't know the exact amount." But, Horbatiuk insists, there were many cases, most of them technically started under Yarema, but at least active under Shokin.</p><p>The numbers quoted by Horbatiuk gibe with those offered by more recent General Prosecutor Rulsan Ryaboshapka, who last year said there were at one time or another &#8220;<a href="https://eadaily.com/ru/news/2019/11/15/genprokuror-ukrainy-rasskazal-o-rassledovanii-del-po-kompanii-burisma">13 or 14</a>&#8221; cases in existence involving Burisma or Zlochevsky.</p></blockquote><p>Taibbi reviews real-time reporting in both Ukraine and the U.S. to document several other pending investigations against Burisma and Zlochevsky that was overseen by the prosecutor whose firing Biden demanded. He notes that Shokhin himself has repeatedly said he was pursuing several investigations against Zlochevsky at the time Biden demanded his firing. In sum, Taibbi concludes, "one can&#8217;t say there&#8217;s no evidence of active Burisma cases even during the last days of Shokin, who says that it was the February, 2016 seizure order [against Zlochevsky's assets] that got him fired."</p><p>And, Taibbi notes, "the story looks even odder when one wonders why the United States would exercise so much foreign policy muscle to get Shokin fired, only to allow in a replacement &#8212; Yuri Lutsenko &#8212; who by all accounts was a spectacularly bigger failure in the battle against corruption in general, and Zlochevsky in particular." In sum: "it&#8217;s unquestionable that the cases against Burisma were all closed by Shokin&#8217;s successor, chosen in consultation with Joe Biden, whose son remained on the board of said company for three more years, earning upwards of $50,000 per month."</p><p>The publicly known facts, augmented by the recent emails, texts and on-the-record accounts, suggest serious sleaze by Joe Biden&#8217;s son Hunter in trying to peddle his influence with the Vice President for profit. But they also raise real questions about whether Joe Biden knew about and even himself engaged in a form of legalized corruption. Specifically, these newly revealed information suggest Biden was using his power to benefit his son&#8217;s business Ukrainian associates, and allowing his name to be traded on while Vice President for his son and brother to pursue business opportunities in China. These are questions which a minimally healthy press would want answered, not buried &#8212; regardless of how many similar or worse scandals the Trump family has.</p><p>But the real scandal that has been proven is not the former Vice President&#8217;s misconduct but that of his supporters and allies in the U.S. media. As Taibbi&#8217;s headline put it: &#8220;With the Hunter Biden Expos&#233;, Suppression is a Bigger Scandal Than the Actual Story.&#8221;</p><p></p><a class="image-link image2 image2-613-681" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F491cff4b-43e7-4aca-8477-e9b5c74d2252_681x613.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F491cff4b-43e7-4aca-8477-e9b5c74d2252_681x613.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/491cff4b-43e7-4aca-8477-e9b5c74d2252_681x613.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:613,&quot;width&quot;:681,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:486391,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

One major factor is the undeniable truth that journalists with national outlets based in New York, Washington and West Coast cities overwhelmingly not just favor Joe Biden but are desperate to see Donald Trump defeated.</p><p>It takes an enormous amount of gullibility to believe that any humans are capable of separating such an intense partisan preference from their journalistic judgment. Many barely even bother to pretend: critiques of Joe Biden are often attacked first not by Biden campaign operatives but by political reporters at national news outlets who make little secret of their eagerness to help Biden win.</p><p>But much of this has to do with the fallout from the 2016 election. During that campaign, news outlets, including The Intercept, did their jobs as journalists by reporting on the contents of newsworthy, authentic documents: namely, the emails published by WikiLeaks from the John Podesta and DNC inboxes which, among other things, revealed corruption so severe that it forced the resignation of the top five officials of the DNC. That the materials were hacked, and that intelligence agencies were suggesting Russia was responsible, not negate the newsworthiness of the documents, which is why media outlets across the country repeatedly reported on their contents.</p><p>Nonetheless, journalists have spent four years being attacked as Trump enablers in their overwhelmingly Democratic and liberal cultural circles: the cities in which they live are overwhelmingly Democratic, and their demographic &#8212; large-city, college-educated professionals &#8212; has vanishingly little Trump support. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/25/us/politics/trump-biden-campaign-donations.html?referringSource=articleShare">New York Times survey of campaign data</a> from Monday tells just a part of this story of cultural insularity and homogeniety:</p><blockquote><p>Joe Biden has outraised President Trump on the strength of some of the wealthiest and most educated ZIP codes in the United States, running up the fund-raising score in cities and suburbs so resoundingly that he collected more money than Mr. Trump on all but two days in the last two months....It is not just that much of Mr. Biden&#8217;s strongest support comes overwhelmingly from the two coasts, which it does.... [U]nder Mr. Trump, Republicans have hemorrhaged support from white voters with college degrees. In ZIP codes with a median household income of at least $100,000, Mr. Biden smashed Mr. Trump in fund-raising, $486 million to only $167 million &#8212; accounting for almost his entire financial edge....One Upper West Side ZIP code &#8212; 10024 &#8212; accounted for more than $8 million for Mr. Biden, and New York City in total delivered $85.6 million for him &#8212; more than he raised in every state other than California....</p><p>The median household in the United States was $68,703 in 2019. In ZIP codes above that level, Mr. Biden outraised Mr. Trump by $389.1 million. Below that level, Mr. Trump was actually ahead by $53.4 million.</p></blockquote><p>Wanting to avoid a repeat of feeling scorn and shunning in their own extremely pro-Democratic, anti-Trump circles, national media outlets have spent four years inventing standards for election-year reporting on hacked materials that never previously existed and that are utterly anathema to the core journalistic function. The Washington Post's Executive Editor Marty Baron, for instance, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/marty-baron-warns-wapo-staff-about-covering-hacked-materials">issued a memo</a> full of cautions about how Post reporters should, or should not, discuss hacked materials even if their authenticity is not in doubt.</p><p>That a media outlet should even consider refraining from reporting on materials they know to be authentic and in the public interest because of questions about their provenance is the opposite of how journalism has been practiced. In the days before the 2016 election, for instance, the New York Times received by mail one year of Donald Trump's tax returns and -- despite having <em>no idea who sent it to them or how that person obtained it: was is stolen or hacked by a foreign power? -- </em>the Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/donald-trump-tax.html">reported on its contents</a>.</p><p>When asked by NPR why they would report on documents when they do not know the source let alone the source's motives in providing them, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner David Barstow <a href="https://twitter.com/mikiebarb/status/783379164409847808">compellingly explained</a> what had always been the core principle of journalism: namely, a journalist only cares about two questions -- (1) are documents authentic and (2) are they in the public interest? -- but does not care about what motives a source has in providing the documents or how they were obtained when deciding whether to reporting them:</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/mikiebarb/status/783379164409847808&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Why NYT's David Barstow does not care who leaked us Trump's tax return, or what the motivation was.

They are good at complaining about this, but very bad at asking whether any of their own conduct is responsible for it.</p><p>A media outlet that renounces its core function -- pursuing answers to relevant questions about powerful people -- is one that deserves to lose the public's faith and confidence.

Not content to simply prevent publication of this article at the media outlet I co-founded, these Intercept editors also demanded that I refrain from exercising a separate contractual right to publish this article with any other publication. </p><p>I had no objection to their disagreement with my views of what this Biden evidence shows: as a last-ditch attempt to avoid being censored, I encouraged them to air their disagreements with me by writing their own articles that critique my perspectives and letting readers decide who is right, the way any confident and healthy media outlet would. But modern media outlets do not air dissent; they quash it. So censorship of my article, rather than engagement with it, was the path these Biden-supporting editors chose.</p><p>The censored article will be published on this page shortly (it is now published <a href="https://greenwald.substack.com/p/article-on-joe-and-hunter-biden-censored">here</a>). My letter of intent to resign, which I sent this morning to First Look Media&#8217;s President Michael Bloom, is published below.</p><p>As of now, I will be publishing my journalism here on Substack, where numerous other journalists, including my good friend, the great intrepid reporter Matt Taibbi, have come in order to practice journalism free of the increasingly repressive climate that is engulfing national mainstream media outlets across the country.  </p><p>This was not an easy choice: I am voluntarily sacrificing the support of a large institution and guaranteed salary in exchange for nothing other than a belief that there are enough people who believe in the virtues of independent journalism and the need for free discourse who will be willing to support my work by subscribing. </p><p>Like anyone with young children, a family and numerous obligations, I do this with some trepidation, but also with the conviction that there is no other choice. I could not sleep at night knowing that I allowed any institution to censor what I want to say and believe &#8212; least of all a media outlet I co-founded with the explicit goal of ensuring this never happens to other journalists, let alone to me, let alone because I have written an article critical of a powerful Democratic politician vehemently supported by the editors in the imminent national election.</p><p>But the pathologies, illiberalism, and repressive mentality that led to the bizarre spectacle of my being censored by my own media outlet are ones that are by no means unique to The Intercept. These are the viruses that have contaminated virtually every mainstream center-left political organization, academic institution, and newsroom. I began writing about politics fifteen years ago with the goal of combatting media propaganda and repression, and &#8212; regardless of the risks involved &#8212; simply cannot accept any situation, no matter how secure or lucrative, that forces me to submit my journalism and right of free expression to its suffocating constraints and dogmatic dictates.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://greenwald.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://greenwald.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>From the time</strong> I began writing about politics in 2005, journalistic freedom and editorial independence have been sacrosanct to me. Fifteen years ago, I <a href="http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/">created a blog</a> on the free Blogspot software when I was still working as a lawyer: not with any hopes or plans of starting a new career as a journalist, but just as a citizen concerned about what I was seeing with the War on Terror and civil liberties, and wanting to express what I believed needed to be heard. It was a labor of love, based in an ethos of cause and conviction, dependent upon a guarantee of complete editorial freedom. </p><p>It thrived because the readership I built knew that, even when they disagreed with particular views I was expressing, I was a free and independent voice, unwedded to any faction, controlled by nobody, endeavoring to be as honest as possible about what I was seeing, and always curious about the wisdom of seeing things differently. The title I chose for that blog, &#8220;Unclaimed Territory,&#8221; reflected that spirit of liberation from captivity to any fixed political or intellectual dogma or institutional constraints.</p><p>When Salon offered me a job as a columnist in 2007, and then again when the Guardian did the same in 2012, I accepted their offers on the condition that I would have the right, except in narrowly defined situations (such as articles that could create legal liability for the news outlet), to publish my articles and columns directly to the internet without censorship, advanced editorial interference, or any other intervention permitted or approval needed. Both outlets revamped their publication system to accommodate this condition, and over the many years I worked with them, they always honored those commitments.</p><p>When I <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-24545344">left the Guardian</a> at the height of the Snowden reporting in 2013 in order to create a new media outlet, I did not do so, needless to say, in order to impose upon myself <em>more </em>constraints and restrictions on my journalistic independence. The exact opposite was true: the intended core innovation of The Intercept, above all else, was to create a new media outlets where all talented, responsible journalists would enjoy the same right of editorial freedom I had always insisted upon for myself. As I told former New York Times Executive Editor Bill Keller in a 2013 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/opinion/a-conversation-in-lieu-of-a-column.html">exchange we had in The New York Times</a> about my critiques of mainstream journalism and the idea behind The Intercept: &#8220;editors should be there to empower and enable strong, highly factual, aggressive adversarial journalism, not to serve as roadblocks to neuter or suppress the journalism.&#8221;</p><p>When the three of us as co-founders made the decision early on that we would not attempt to manage the day-to-day operations of the new outlet, so that we could instead focus on our journalism, we negotiated the right of approval for senior editors and, especially the editor-in-chief. The central responsibility of the person holding that title was to implement, in close consultation with us, the unique journalistic vision and journalistic values on which we founded this new media outlet. </p><p>Chief among those values was editorial freedom, the protection of a journalist&#8217;s right to speak in an honest voice, and the airing rather than suppression of dissent from mainstream orthodoxies and even collegial disagreements with one another. That would be accomplished, above all else, by ensuring that journalists, once they fulfilled the first duty of factual accuracy and journalistic ethics, would be not just permitted but encouraged to express political and ideological views that deviated from mainstream orthodoxy and those of their own editors; to express themselves in their own voice of passion and conviction rather stuffed into the corporatized, contrived tone of artificial objectivity, above-it-all omnipotence; and to be completely free of anyone else&#8217;s dogmatic beliefs or ideological agenda &#8212; including those of the three co-founders.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>The current iteration</strong> of The Intercept is completely unrecognizable when compared to that original vision. Rather than offering a venue for airing dissent, marginalized voices and unheard perspectives, it is rapidly becoming just another media outlet with mandated ideological and partisan loyalties, a rigid and narrow range of permitted viewpoints (ranging from establishment liberalism to soft leftism, but always anchored in ultimate support for the Democratic Party), a deep fear of offending hegemonic cultural liberalism and center-left Twitter luminaries, and an overarching need to secure the approval and admiration of the very mainstream media outlets we created The Intercept to oppose, critique and subvert. </p><p>As a result, it is a rare event indeed when a radical freelance voice unwelcome in mainstream precincts is published in The Intercept. Outside reporters or writers with no claim to mainstream acceptability &#8212; exactly the people we set out to amplify &#8212; have almost no chance of being published. It is even rarer for The Intercept to publish content that would not fit very comfortably in at least a dozen or more center-left publications of similar size which pre-dated its founding, from Mother Jones to Vox and even MSNBC. </p><p>Courage is required to step out of line, to question and poke at those pieties most sacred in one&#8217;s own milieu, but fear of alienating the guardians of liberal orthodoxy, especially on Twitter, is the predominant attribute of The Intercept&#8217;s New-York based editorial leadership team. As a result, The Intercept has all but abandoned its core mission of challenging and poking at, rather than appeasing and comforting, the institutions and guardians most powerful in its cultural and political circles.</p><p>Making all of this worse, The Intercept &#8212; while gradually excluding the co-founders from any role in its editorial mission or direction, and making one choice after the next to which I vocally objected as a betrayal of our core mission &#8212; continued publicly to trade on my name in order to raise funds for journalism it knew I did not support. It purposely allowed the perception to fester that I was the person responsible for its journalistic mistakes in order to ensure that blame for those mistakes was heaped on me rather than the editors who were consolidating control and were responsible for them.</p><p>The most egregious, but by no means only, example of exploiting my name to evade responsibility was the Reality Winner debacle. As The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/business/media/the-intercept-source-reality-winner.html">recently reported</a>, that was a story in which I had no involvement whatsoever. While based in Brazil, I was never asked to work on the documents which Winner sent to our New York newsroom with no request that any specific journalist work on them. I did not even learn of the existence of that document until very shortly prior to its publication. The person who oversaw, edited and controlled that story was Betsy Reed, which was how it should be given the magnitude and complexity of that reporting and her position as editor-in-chief.</p><p>It was Intercept editors who pressured the story&#8217;s reporters to quickly send those documents for authentication to the government &#8212; because they was eager to prove to mainstream media outlets and prominent liberals that The Intercept was willing to get on board the Russiagate train. They wanted to counter-act the perception, created by my articles expressing skepticism about the central claims of that scandal, that The Intercept had stepped out of line on a story of high importance to U.S. liberalism and even the left. That craving &#8212; to secure the approval of the very mainstream media outlets we set out to counteract &#8212; was the root cause for the speed and recklessness with which that document from Winner was handled.</p><p>But The Intercept, to this very day, has refused to provide any public accounting of what happened in the Reality Winner story: to explain who the editors were who made mistakes and why any of it happened. As the New York Times article makes clear, that refusal persists to this very day notwithstanding vocal demands from myself, Scahill, Laura Poitras and others that The Intercept, as an institution that demands transparency from others, has the obligation to provide it for itself. </p><p>The reason for this silence and this cover-up is obvious: accounting to the public about what happened with the Reality Winner story would reveal who the actual editors are who are responsible for that deeply embarrassing newsroom failure, and that would negate their ability to continue to hide behind me and let the public continue to assume that I was the person at fault for a reporting process from which I was completely excluded from the start. That is just one example illustrating the frustrating dilemma of having a newsroom exploit my name, work and credibility when it is convenient to do so, while increasingly denying me any opportunity to influence its journalistic mission and editorial direction, all while pursuing an editorial mission completely anathema to what I believe.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Despite all of this</strong>, I did not want to leave The Intercept. As it deteriorated and abandoned its original mission, I reasoned to myself &#8212; perhaps rationalized &#8212; that as long as The Intercept at least continued to provide me the resources to personally do the journalism I believe in, and never to interfere in or impede my editorial freedom, I could swallow everything else. </p><p>But the brute censorship this week of my article &#8212; about the Hunter Biden materials and Joe Biden&#8217;s conduct regarding Ukraine and China, as well my critique of the media&#8217;s rank-closing attempt, in a deeply unholy union with Silicon Valley and the &#8220;intelligence community,&#8221; to suppress its revelations &#8212; eroded the last justification I could cling to for staying. It meant that not only does this media outlet not provide the editorial freedom to <em>other journalists</em>, as I had so hopefully envisioned seven years ago, but now no longer even provides it to me. In the days heading into a presidential election, I am somehow silenced from expressing any views that random editors in New York find disagreeable, and now somehow have to conform my writing and reporting to cater to their partisan desires and eagerness to elect specific candidates. </p><p>To say that such censorship is a red line for me, a situation I would never accept no matter the cost, is an understatement. It is astonishing to me, but also a reflection of our current discourse and illiberal media environment, that I have been silenced about Joe Biden by my own media outlet.</p><p>Numerous other episodes were also contributing causes to my decision to leave: the Reality Winner cover-up; the decision to hang Lee Fang out to dry and even force <em>him</em> to apologize when a colleague tried to destroy his reputation by publicly, baselessly and repeatedly branding him a racist; its refusal to report on the daily proceedings of the Assange extradition hearing because the freelance reporter doing an outstanding job was politically distasteful; its utter lack of editorial standards when it comes to viewpoints or reporting that flatter the beliefs of its liberal base (The Intercept published some of the most credulous and false affirmations of maximalist Russiagate madness, and, horrifyingly, took the lead in falsely branding the Hunter Biden archive as &#8220;Russian disinformation&#8221; by mindlessly and uncritically citing &#8212; of all things &#8212; a letter by former CIA officials that contained this baseless insinuation).</p><p>I know it sounds banal to say, but &#8212; even with all of these frustrations and failures &#8212; I am leaving, and writing this, with genuine sadness, not fury. That news outlet is something I and numerous close friends and colleagues poured an enormous amount of our time, energy, passion and love into building. </p><p>The Intercept has done great work. Its editorial leaders and First Look&#8217;s managers steadfastly supported the <a href="https://apnews.com/0e998ebedbd64f6d868a3fa570ed1f6c">difficult and dangerous reporting</a> I did last year with my brave young colleagues at The Intercept Brasil to expose corruption at the highest levels of the Bolsonaro government, and stood behind us as we endured <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/world/americas/greenwald-charges-dropped-brazil.html">threats of death and imprisonment</a>.</p><p>It continues to employ some of my closest friends, outstanding journalists whose work &#8212; when it overcomes editorial resistance &#8212; produces nothing but the highest admiration from me: Jeremy Scahill, Lee Fang, Murtaza Hussain, Naomi Klein, Ryan Grim and others. And I have no personal animus for anyone there, nor any desire to hurt it as an institution. Betsy Reed is an exceptionally smart editor and a very good human being with whom I developed a close and valuable friendship. And Pierre Omidyar, the original funder and publisher of First Look, always honored his personal commitment never to interfere in our editorial process even when I was publishing articles directly at odds with his strongly held views and even when I was attacking other institutions he was funding. I&#8217;m not leaving out of vengeance or personal conflict but out of conviction and cause.</p><p>And none of the critiques I have voiced about The Intercept are unique to it. To the contrary: these are the raging battles over free expression and the right of dissent raging within every major cultural, political and journalistic institution. That&#8217;s the crisis that journalism, and more broadly values of liberalism, faces. Our discourse is becoming increasingly intolerant of dissenting views, and our culture is demanding more and more submission to prevailing orthodoxies imposed by self-anointed monopolists of Truth and Righteousness, backed up by armies of online enforcement mobs. </p><p>And nothing is crippled by that trend more severely than journalism, which, above all else, requires the ability of journalists to offend and anger power centers, question or reject sacred pieties, unearth facts that reflect negatively even on (<em>especially on</em>)<em> </em>the most beloved and powerful figures, and highlight corruption no matter where it is found and regardless of who is benefited or injured by its exposure.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Prior to the extraordinary</strong> experience of being censored this week by my own news outlet, I had already been exploring the possibility of creating a new media outlet. I have spent a couple of months in active discussions with some of the most interesting, independent and vibrant journalists, writers and commentators across the political spectrum about the feasibility of securing financing for a new outlet that would be designed to combat these trends. The first two paragraphs of our working document reads as follows:</p><blockquote><p>American media is gripped in a polarized culture war that is forcing journalism to conform to tribal, groupthink narratives that are often divorced from the truth and cater to perspectives that are not reflective of the broader public but instead a minority of hyper-partisan elites. The need to conform to highly restrictive, artificial cultural narratives and partisan identities has created a repressive and illiberal environment in which vast swaths of news and reporting either do not happen or are presented through the most skewed and reality-detached lens. </p><p>With nearly all major media institutions captured to some degree by this dynamic, a deep need exists for media that is untethered and free to transgress the boundaries of this polarized culture war and address a demand from a public that is starved for media that doesn&#8217;t play for a side but instead pursues lines of reporting, thought, and inquiry wherever they lead, without fear of violating cultural pieties or elite orthodoxies. </p></blockquote><p>I have definitely not relinquished hope that this ambitious project can be accomplished. And I theoretically could have stayed at The Intercept until then, guaranteeing a stable and secure income for my family by swallowing the dictates of my new censors. </p><p>But I would be deeply ashamed if I did that, and believe I would be betraying my own principles and convictions that I urge others to follow. So in the meantime, I have decided to follow in the footsteps of numerous other writers and journalists who have been expelled from increasingly repressive journalistic precincts for various forms of heresy and dissent and who have sought refuge here. </p><p>I hope to exploit the freedom this new platform offers not only to continue to publish the independent and hard-hitting investigative journalism and candid analysis and opinion writing that my readers have come to expect, but also to develop a podcast, and continue the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0Gy9pTgVntTChFgj0xwMrsc1GO32-DZ&amp;app=desktop">YouTube program</a>, &#8220;System Update,&#8221; I launched earlier this year in partnership with The Intercept.</p><p>To do that, to make this viable, I will need your support: people who are able to subscribe and sign up for the newsletter attached to this platform will enable my work to thrive and still be heard, perhaps even more so than before. I began my journalism career by depending on my readers&#8217; willingness to support independent journalism which they believe is necessary to sustain. It is somewhat daunting at this point in my life, but also very exciting, to return to that model where one answers only to the public a journalist should be serving. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://greenwald.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://greenwald.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>* * * * * * * *</p><p><em><strong>LETTER OF INTENT TO RESIGN</strong></em></p><p>-------- Forwarded Message --------</p><p>Subject: ResignationDate: Thu, 29 Oct 2020 10:20:54 -0300From: Glenn Greenwald &lt;xxxxxxxx@theintercept.com&gt;To: Michael Bloom &lt;xxxxxxxxx@firstlook.media&gt;, Betsy Reed &lt;xxxxxxx@theintercept.com&gt;</p><p>Michael - </p><p>I am writing to advise you that I have decided that I will be resigning from First Look Media (FLM) and The Intercept. </p><p>The precipitating (but by no means only) cause is that The Intercept is attempting to censor my articles in violation of both my contract and fundamental principles of editorial freedom. The latest and perhaps most egregious example is an opinion column I wrote this week which, five days before the presidential election, is critical of Joe Biden, the candidate who happens to be vigorously supported by all of the Intercept editors in New York who are imposing the censorship and refusing to publish the article unless I agree to remove all of the sections critical of the candidate they want to win. All of that violates the right in my contract with FLM to publish articles without editorial interference except in very narrow circumstances that plainly do not apply here.</p><p>Worse, The Intercept editors in New York, not content to censor publication of my article at the Intercept, are also demanding that I not exercise my separate contractual right with FLM regarding articles I have written but which FLM does not want to publish itself. Under my contract, I have the right to publish any articles FLM rejects with another publication. But Intercept editors in New York are demanding I not only accept their censorship of my article at The Intercept, but also refrain from publishing it with any other journalistic outlet, and are using thinly disguised lawyer-crafted threats to coerce me not to do so (proclaiming it would be &#8220;detrimental&#8221; to The Intercept if I published it elsewhere). </p><p>I have been extremely disenchanted and saddened by the editorial direction of The Intercept under its New York leadership for quite some time. The publication we founded without those editors back in 2014 now bears absolutely no resemblance to what we set out to build -- not in content, structure, editorial mission or purpose. I have grown embarrassed to have my name used as a fund-raising tool to support what it is doing and for editors to use me as a shield to hide behind to avoid taking responsibility for their mistakes (including, but not only, with the Reality Winner debacle, for which I was publicly blamed despite having no role in it, while the editors who actually were responsible for those mistakes stood by silently, allowing me to be blamed for their errors and then covering-up any public accounting of what happened, knowing that such transparency would expose their own culpability).</p><p>But all this time, as things worsened, I reasoned that as long as The Intercept remained a place where my own right of journalistic independence was not being infringed, I could live with all of its other flaws. But now, not even that minimal but foundational right is being honored for my own journalism, suppressed by an increasingly authoritarian, fear-driven, repressive editorial team in New York bent on imposing their own ideological and partisan preferences on all writers while ensuring that nothing is published at The Intercept that contradicts their own narrow, homogenous ideological and partisan views: <em>exactly</em> what The Intercept, more than any other goal, was created to prevent.</p><p>I have asked my lawyer to get in touch with FLM to discuss how best to terminate my contract.
